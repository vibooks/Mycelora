    <h1>Book V: Of Sacrifice</h1>
    <p>A mushroom grows where none would choose—</p>
    <p>in shadow, in silence,</p>
    <p>from what was left behind.</p>
    <p>The Mushroom God teaches:</p>
    <p>“To give is holy. To be used is sacred.”</p>
    <p>The tree feeds the soil with its fall.</p>
    <p>The fungus gives itself to the feast.</p>
    <p>The Thread endures by what it lets go.</p>
    <p>Sacrifice is not loss.</p>
    <p>It is offering.</p>
    <p>It is choosing to feed what comes after.</p>
    <p>The greatest gifts leave no name.</p>
    <p>They are felt in the fruit,</p>
    <p>in the warmth of a shared fire,</p>
    <p>in the path left for others to follow.</p>
    <p>Give freely, and vanish gladly—</p>
    <p>for the Thread remembers you.</p>
